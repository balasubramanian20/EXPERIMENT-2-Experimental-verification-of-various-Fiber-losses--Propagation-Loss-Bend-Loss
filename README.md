**Theory:**  
- Losses due to absorption, scattering, bending  
- Plastic fiber loss ~180 dB/km  
- Bending loss increases with reduced loop diameter  

**Procedure:**  
- Setup for 660nm and 950nm measurements  
- Measure output voltages for 1m and 3m fibers  
- Calculate attenuation \( a \) using:  
V1/V2 = e [ -a (L1+L2 ) ] 
- Bend fiber and record output vs diameter  

**Tabulation:**

### Propagation Loss

| Fiber Length | Input Amplitude (V) | Output Amplitude (V) |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------------|
|      1        |         5            |          10
|     0.5       |         5             |          14         |


### Bending Loss

| Bending Diameter | Input Amplitude (V) | Output Amplitude (V) |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
|         1 for 8cm |      5               |   10.3                    
|   0.5 for 6.4cm   |       5              |   9.56              |

**Result:**

Attenuation and bending loss characteristics verified.
The propagation (transmission) loss was measured over different lengths of the fiber for two wavelengths (660 nm & 950 nm) and found to increase with length, confirming the expected attenuation behaviour.

The bending loss was observed by varying the loop diameter of the fiber and measuring output amplitude — as the bend diameter decreased, the output dropped, verifying increased bending loss.

Hence, the aim of measuring both propagation loss and bending loss characteristics of the fiber was achieved.
